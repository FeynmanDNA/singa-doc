Apache SINGA V3.0.0 is released on April 18, 2020. This is the first official
release since SINGA became the first Top-Level Apache project. There are three
major features added in this release.

First, a new Python class [Module](/docs/module) is introduced. New models
(neural networks) can be implemented by inheriting it. The benefit is that SINGA
will create a computational graph at the backend for speed and memory
optimization.

Second, the [soonx](/docs/onnx) module is enhanced to support more ONNX
operators. Multiple ONNX models have been tested for training and inference
using SINGA.

Last, communication optimization for [distributed training](docs/dist-train),
including gradient sparsification and compression. NCCL is integrated as the
communication library.

Please check the [overview page](/docs/software-stack) and detailed
[guides](/docs/installation).
